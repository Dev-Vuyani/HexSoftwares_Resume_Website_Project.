        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a driven final-year student eager to make an impact in the tech industry.<br>  
            With a passion for technology, I am dedicated to creating meaningful and innovative solutions in the world of software development.<br><br>  
        
            I have a solid foundation and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, React, and MySQL.<br>  
            My goal is to become a skilled software developer, capable of developing cutting-edge solutions that transform lives.<br><br>  
        
            In addition to my technical skills, I have gained valuable experience serving as a student assistant under FASSET.<br>  
            Our primary goal was to guide students in their academics by offering tutorials, emotional support, and academic assistance.<br>  
            This role allowed me to develop strong mentorship, leadership, and problem-solving skills, further enhancing my ability to work collaboratively and support others in their learning journey.<br>
